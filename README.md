# Welcome to the CUW Hackathon Spring 2023 sponsored by Aurora WDC! 

## Challenge overview

In this challenge, you will explore 3 web3 platforms based on three different ecosystems. Below are the three:

  - [Nostr](https://nostr.com/): Based on the [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) ecosystem
  - [Lens Protocol](https://www.lens.xyz/): Based on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) ecosystem
  - [CyberConnect](https://docs.cyberconnect.me/): Based on the [Solana](https://solana.com/) ecosystem (P.S: If CyberConnect does not open on Chrome, please use another browser)

Teams get to pick which ecosystem they'd like to learn and work with and the goal is to get a prototype out of either of these.

## Steps for this Hackathon

* Fork this Repo and use your version as the code and documentation repository for the Web3 Social Media Platform you'll build (like [DiamondApp](https://diamondapp.com/browse?feedTab=Hot), [Steem](https://steem.com/) or whatever you'll be able to find)
* The Web3 or Decentralized Social Platform should have facility for the following:
  - Ability to create an account (with the option to sign-up using a wallet address like Metamask)
  - Ability to Post and interact with posts (Like, Reply, Share)
  - Ability to create and/or Join Groups
  - Ability to create events


## Prizes

Up to (3) teams will be chosen. The first team receive a price of $300 and the (2) runner-up teams receive $100 each.
